= Understanding var, let, and const. 

There are 3 ways to declare a variable. +

* var 
* let 
* const

The oldest of them all is *var*. It has its weaknesses so which is why *let* and *const* were added. 

=== var can be reassigned and redeclared

*var* has been around before let and const. Var let's you *reassign* the variable

For example below:

```
var howManyCats = 3;
console.log('I started with ' + howManyCats + ' cats.');
howManyCats = 20;
console.log('Now I have ' + howManyCats + ' cats. I have a problem.')
```

You can also redeclare *var*, but we cannot redeclare *let* and *const*. 
Here is what the console will give if you redeclare with *var*

If I did the same using *let* or *const* (but in this example I use let), I will get an error: _SyntaxError: Identifier 'numba' has already been declared_

In retrospect, it's most likely not a good idea to redeclare a variable because most of the time it was an accident. 
so having *let* and *const* preventing you from redeclaring a variable can actually be a good safety net. 


=== var is function scope

If we assigned a variable inside of a function, it cannot be used outside of that function.

```
function who() {
    var name = 'Emily'
}
console.log(name)
```

The code above will give the error: _"Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined."_

It will work if we assigned the variable outside of the function, but now it is a global variable. 


```
var name;
function who() {
    name = 'Emily'
}

console.log(name)
```

However, if you assign a variable inside of an if statement, and if the condition is met, the *var* is in the global scope. 
for example: 

```
var num = 2;

if (num < 5) {
  var text = 'I really love to eat chicken';
  console.log(text)
}
```

You can access the variable by simply typing in the variable name.

If you wanted to keep it away from the global scope and use *var*, you can insert it into an *Immediate function invocation* also known as *IFI* which looks like this:

```
(function () {

})();

```
With the same if statement inside of an *IFI*, the variable _text_ is now not in the global scope 
and will give a _Reference error: text is not defined_.

=== Let and Const is Block Scope

*let* and *const* is a new addition that prevents this from happening by keeping it in the block's scope. 
*block* is what is inside the curly brackets: *{   in here   }*.

If I used the same code but instead of *var* and used *let* inside the if statement block, it won't let me access the variable _text_ in console. The
same will happen with *const*

Another benefit to *let* and *const* keeping the variable inside the block scope is that you can reuse a variable name. It has already been addressed that *let* and *const* will not allow you to redeclare a variable, 
so knowing that, even though the variable has the same name, they are not linked.

=== Reassigning with let, but not const 

*let* and *var* will let you reassign a variable, but *const* will not. Mainly because *const* stands for constant. 

Here is *let* being reassigned to something different:

Here is *const* attempting to do the same:

While of course *const* will let you output the first console log, but for the reassignment to _american_, it won't allow that. 

*const* cannot be reassigned or redeclared, but its object properties can be changed.

A little trick learned from Wes Bos using *Object.freeze(objectVariable)*, you can have an object that strictly cannot be changed.

=== For loop with var, let, and const. 

The for loop is where you can see the difference between the three *var*, *let*, and *const*. 

In the example, the for loop will count from 0 till it's less than 5. 1 second later, it will show what the variable _i_ is. 

*var*: 
when using var, you can see that _i_ has been overwritten. During the setTimeout, it's not counting
anymore, but it is spitting out the same _i_ less than 5 times as commanded from the forloop.

*let*: 

If you don't want your variable to be overwritten in the forloop, the best one to use is *let*. 
Since the variable is constrained to the block, the variable will not be overwritten. The setTimeout will count to less than 5 as well.

*const*: 

const on the otherhand, since const won't let you reassign, it will stay as 0.

== Summary 

To put it simply: 

* *var*: can be reassigned and redeclared. Is function scope. Use var if the variable is top-level and needs to be shared across many scopes.
* *let*: can be reassigned, but cannot be redeclared. Is block scope. Use let for localized variable in smaller scopes.
* *const*: cannot be reassigned and redeclared. Is block scope. When refactoring your code, switch let to const if the variable shouldn't be reassigned.
