= Misc Javascript and ES6+


== Default Function Arguments 



== Object Literal 

object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs
that are wrapped in curly braces:

```
const me = {
    name: 'pepper',
    age: 180,
    height: 50
}
```

object literal can be any data type such as *array literals*, *nested object literals*, *functions*

```
const sandwich = {
    types: ['BLT', 'the one with cheese and ham', 'actually I only like BLT']
    blt: {
        quantity: 2,
        size: 1,
        toasted: 0
    },
    message: function() {
        alert('Do not mess up my sandwich')
    }
}

```

== Temporal Dead Zone 

The temporal dead zone is when you cannot access the variable
before it is defined. Which will happen with *let* and *const*. 

*var* will let you access the variable but not its value giving you the error: _undefined_

*let and const* will not let you access the variable and will give the error: Uncaught ReferenceError: kitty is not defined.
